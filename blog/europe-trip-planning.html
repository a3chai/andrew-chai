        <p>
            After years of saying "someday," I've finally committed to a 4-month backpacking trip through Europe.
            The plan is to leave in late spring and return just before the fall semester starts. Here's how I'm
            approaching the planning process, and some lessons I've learned so far.
        </p>

        <h2>The Rough Itinerary</h2>

        <p>
            I'm starting with a loose framework rather than a rigid day-by-day plan. The beauty of having
            4 months is the flexibility to stay longer in places I love and move on quickly from places that
            don't click.
        </p>

        <p>My rough route looks something like this:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Switzerland (2-3 weeks)</strong> - Starting with the Swiss Alps. Zermatt, Lauterbrunnen, and the Bernese Oberland are top priorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Northern Italy / Dolomites (2-3 weeks)</strong> - The Tre Cime hike and some via ferrata routes have been on my list for years.</li>
            <li><strong>Slovenia (1 week)</strong> - Lake Bled, Ljubljana, and the Julian Alps.</li>
            <li><strong>Croatia (2 weeks)</strong> - Split, Dubrovnik, and some island hopping.</li>
            <li><strong>Greece (2-3 weeks)</strong> - Athens, the islands, and maybe some lesser-known spots in the Peloponnese.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Europe (3-4 weeks)</strong> - Vienna, Prague, Budapest. The classic circuit.</li>
            <li><strong>Germany (2 weeks)</strong> - Munich, Berlin, and maybe the Black Forest.</li>
            <li><strong>Scandinavia (2-3 weeks)</strong> - If the budget holds up. Norway's fjords are calling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Budget Breakdown</h2>

        <p>
            The biggest question everyone asks: how much does a 4-month Europe trip cost? Here's my rough budget:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "The goal is around $15,000-18,000 total, which works out to about $125-150 per day including everything.
                Switzerland and Scandinavia will blow this budget; Eastern Europe will balance it out."
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I'm planning to split costs roughly as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accommodation (40%)</strong> - Mix of hostels, the occasional Airbnb, and maybe some camping in the Alps.</li>
            <li><strong>Food (25%)</strong> - Cooking when possible, splurging occasionally on local specialties.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation (20%)</strong> - Trains, buses, and maybe a Eurail pass for part of the trip.</li>
            <li><strong>Activities (15%)</strong> - Museums, hikes with guides, via ferrata gear rental, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm Packing</h2>

        <p>
            As an engineer, I've probably over-optimized my packing list. I'm going with a 40L backpack as my
            only bag - no checked luggage, no wheeled suitcase. Everything needs to earn its weight.
        </p>

        <p>The key items:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Merino wool base layers (they don't smell as quickly)</li>
            <li>Lightweight rain jacket that doubles as a wind layer</li>
            <li>Trail runners instead of heavy hiking boots</li>
            <li>Kindle (can't bring 4 months of books)</li>
            <li>Minimal tech: phone, small laptop for occasional work, one camera</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning from Others</h2>

        <p>
            I've spent the last few months consuming every travel blog, YouTube video, and Reddit thread
            I can find about long-term Europe travel. A few key lessons:
        </p>

        <h3>Book Accommodation 1-2 Days Ahead, Not Months</h3>
        <p>
            Over-planning kills flexibility. I'm only pre-booking for places where hostels fill up fast
            (like Interlaken in peak season) or where I have specific dates I can't change.
        </p>

        <h3>Shoulder Season is the Sweet Spot</h3>
        <p>
            Late May/early June and September are ideal. Fewer crowds, better prices, and the weather
            is still good for hiking.
        </p>

        <h3>Take Rest Days</h3>
        <p>
            "Travel burnout" is real. Planning to spend at least one day per week doing absolutely nothing -
            no sightseeing, no trains, just reading in a cafe or wandering without a destination.
        </p>

        <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

        <p>
            Over the coming months, I'll be sharing updates on the planning process, gear reviews,
            and eventually dispatches from the road. If you've done a similar trip or have recommendations,
            I'd love to hear from you.
        </p>

        <p>
            For now, back to studying for finals - Europe will still be there in May.
        </p>
