        <p>
            Six months ago, I decided to start learning Mandarin Chinese. Not for any practical reason at first -
            I was just fascinated by the writing system and wanted a challenge outside of engineering. Here's
            what I've learned about learning itself along the way.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Mandarin?</h2>

        <p>
            Honestly, the initial motivation was curiosity. The idea of a tonal language with thousands of
            characters felt like reverse-engineering a completely alien system. As someone who spends most of
            their time looking at schematics and datasheets, I wanted something completely different.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's also the practical side: China dominates electronics manufacturing. Being able to read
            component datasheets, navigate Taobao, or communicate with suppliers - even at a basic level -
            seemed genuinely useful.
        </p>

        <h2>The Engineering Approach to Language Learning</h2>

        <p>
            I approached Mandarin the same way I'd approach learning a new microcontroller architecture:
            understand the fundamentals first, build a solid foundation, then iterate.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 1: The Core System</h3>
        <p>
            Before memorizing vocabulary, I spent the first few weeks just understanding how the language
            works. Tones, pinyin, stroke order, radical systems. It's like reading the reference manual
            before writing code - tedious but essential.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Spaced Repetition</h3>
        <p>
            Anki became my best friend. I built custom decks with audio, pinyin, and characters. The
            algorithm is essentially exponential backoff for memory - you review cards right before
            you're about to forget them. Engineers will appreciate the efficiency.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "The spacing effect is one of the most reliable findings in memory research. If you're
                not using spaced repetition, you're leaving performance on the table."
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Phase 3: Immersion and Input</h3>
        <p>
            Once I had a base vocabulary (~500 characters), I started consuming content. Graded readers,
            YouTube channels with Chinese subtitles, podcasts. The goal was comprehensible input -
            material that's slightly above your current level.
        </p>

        <h2>What Worked</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistency over intensity</strong> - 30 minutes every day beats 4 hours once a week. I treat it like a daily standup.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn characters, not just pinyin</strong> - Reading characters forces you to actually learn them. Pinyin is a crutch.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on high-frequency words</strong> - The top 1000 words cover ~90% of everyday conversation. Optimize for ROI.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadowing practice</strong> - Repeating audio in real-time improved my tones dramatically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Didn't Work</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grammar textbooks</strong> - Too abstract without enough examples. Context matters more.</li>
            <li><strong>Trying to learn too many characters at once</strong> - Quality over quantity. 10 well-learned characters beat 50 half-learned ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglecting output</strong> - Reading and listening are easier than speaking and writing. Need to practice all four.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Tools</h2>

        <p>
            For anyone interested in starting, here's my current stack:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anki</strong> - Spaced repetition flashcards (free, open source)</li>
            <li><strong>Pleco</strong> - The best Chinese dictionary app. Essential for looking up characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Du Chinese</strong> - Graded readers with audio and inline translation</li>
            <li><strong>HelloChinese</strong> - Good for absolute beginners, gamified learning</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube</strong> - Channels like Comprehensible Chinese and Mandarin Corner</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>

        <p>
            After six months of consistent practice, I can:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Read simple texts and short stories</li>
            <li>Hold basic conversations about everyday topics</li>
            <li>Understand maybe 60-70% of simple YouTube videos</li>
            <li>Recognize around 800 characters</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It's not fluency, but it's progress. The journey from "what do these symbols even mean" to
            "I can actually read this" has been incredibly rewarding.
        </p>

        <h2>The Meta-Lesson</h2>

        <p>
            The biggest takeaway isn't about Mandarin specifically - it's about learning itself. The
            same principles that make you good at picking up new programming languages or hardware
            platforms apply to human languages too: systematic practice, spaced repetition, lots of
            input, and consistent effort over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're an engineer thinking about learning a new language, I'd encourage you to try.
            It exercises completely different mental muscles, and there's something deeply satisfying
            about decoding a system that billions of people use every day.
        </p>
